## The Model

The vehicle model I used is almost the same as provided in the [lecture](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/338b458f-7ebf-449c-9ad1-611eb933b076/concepts/d26b8460-653f-4479-bc24-68bb62c146ba) and developed in the [quiz](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/338b458f-7ebf-449c-9ad1-611eb933b076/concepts/d3df10cc-797a-47ae-82c9-a39a597870d9). The main difference is the quantities and order of quantities included in the solver result (i.e. this version includes delta and a first, then the x and y coordinates.) It consists of the following:
* The state of the car, represented by the following quantities [x, y, psi, v]:
  * Car position (**x**, **y**)
  * Car speed (**v**)
  * Car direction/orientation angle (**psi**)
* The car actuators, represented by the following quantities [delta, a]:
  * Steering angle (**delta**) - this models rotating the  steering wheel
  * Acceleration (**a**) - this models pressing the throttle pedal or the brake pedal (and putting the car in reverse if the value is negative)
* The errors that are generated due to the difference between the **reference trajectory** that we want to follow (yellow line in video) and the **actual trajectory** generated by our control module (green line in video) are represented by the following quantities [cte, epsi]:
  * Cross track error (**cte**) - defined as the error between the center of the road and the vehicle's position.
  * Direction/orientation error (**epsi**) - defined as the desired orientation subtracted from the current orientation.
* All of the state, actuator and error quantities are assembled into a single 'state' vector that gets updated on each iteration [x, y, psi, v, cte, epsi]. 
* The Model Predictive Control users an optimizer function to minimize a cost function that returns the best set of control inputs. The state update equations are (Note **dt** is the time difference between the current and previous update):
  1. Future position:
    a. Future x = x + v * cos(psi) * dt
    b. Future y = y + v * sin(psi) * dt
  2. Future direction/orientation = psi + v/Lf * delta * dt
    * Lf is a constant that represents the length from front to CoG.
  3. Future speed = v + a * dt
  4. Future cross track error = f(x) - y + v * sin(epsi) * dt
    * f(x) is the reference curve represented by a 3rd order polynomial
  5. Future direction/orientation error = psi - psides + v/Lf * delta * dt
    * psides is the tangential angle of the polynomial f(x) evaluated at x. It can be calculated via arctan(f'(x))

## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

After many iterations, the following values were chosen for timestep length and elapsed duration:
* N = 15
* dt = 0.15

These values enabled for a prediction calculation of 15 x 0.15 = 2.25 seconds into the future, which allowed a good balance of computations needed (higher N means more computations per prediction cycle.) Also in my particular PC setup, this enabled the green line to stay a small distance ahead of the yellow line which resulted in earlier and more 'accurate' reactions to track features like tight turns.
Other values tried:
* N = 25, 30, 40
* dt = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5

Higher N values would create unpredictability in the driving reactions which would end in the car driving off the road. Lower or higher values of dt did not seem to work well with the required latency of 100 ms. Because the actuators only trigger after 100 ms we need to ensure the actuator inputs are calculated at the right time.

## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
(see [main.cpp](src/main.cpp) lines 112-121) The original reference trajectory markers are defined in the global coordinate system of the simlulator. During pre-processing we shift these values to the car coordinate system, making px, py and psi all zero.

(see [main.cpp](src/main.cpp) lines 125-127) The reference trajectory markers' x and y coordinates are used to fit a 3rd degree polynomial whose coefficients together with the car state vector are passed to the MPC solver which returns the predicted **steering angle**, **acceleration** and x and y coordinates.

## Model Predictive Control with Latency
The 100 milisecond latency requirement was accomplished by experimenting with different timestep length and elapsed duration values as described above.

## Dependencies 

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * If challenges to installation are encountered (install script fails).  Please review this thread for tips on installing Ipopt.
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
       +  Some Mac users have experienced the following error:
       ```
       Listening to port 4567
       Connected!!!
       mpc(4561,0x7ffff1eed3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f911e007600: incorrect checksum for freed object
       - object was probably modified after being freed.
       *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
       ```
       This error has been resolved by updrading ipopt with
       ```brew upgrade ipopt --with-openblas```
       per this [forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/incorrect-checksum-for-freed-object/313433/19).
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/).
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`. 
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.
